soccer is awesome
soccer is defined as the fine art of using legs to knock a round and spherical shape in to a box. Players run arnd the field in a pointless 80 min duration before declaring one a winner as the loser go home in shame and die in the end, although that is rather exaggerated, I must say.

Soccer can also be called football and many people around the world have an interest in this sport, mainly teenagers.
